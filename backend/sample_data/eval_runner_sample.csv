q001,What is the infield fly rule in baseball?,The infield fly rule prevents the defense from intentionally dropping a fly ball to turn a double play. It applies when there are runners on first and second (or bases loaded) with less than two outs.,"The infield fly rule is invoked when there are runners on first and second base (or bases loaded) with fewer than two outs, and a fair fly ball is hit that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. The batter is automatically out, preventing the defense from intentionally dropping the ball to create a double or triple play.",Baseball rules state that the infield fly rule applies with runners on first and second or bases loaded with less than two outs.
q002,Explain how photosynthesis works,Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. They absorb carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen.,"Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in chloroplasts where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The process combines CO2 and H2O to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and releases O2 as a byproduct.",Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The light-dependent reactions happen in the thylakoid membranes.
q003,What causes seasons on Earth?,Seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis as it orbits the Sun. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun it experiences summer while the Southern Hemisphere has winter.,"Earth's seasons are caused by the 23.5-degree tilt of Earth's rotational axis relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt causes different hemispheres to receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year, creating the seasonal cycle.",Earth's axial tilt is approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt remains constant as Earth orbits the Sun over the course of a year.
q004,How does a blockchain work?,A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. Each block contains transaction data and is linked to the previous block through cryptographic hashes making the chain tamper-resistant.,"A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter historical records without detection.",Blockchain technology uses cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA-256. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake validate new blocks.
q005,What is the difference between RAM and ROM?,RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory used for temporary data storage while the computer is running. ROM (Read Only Memory) is non-volatile and stores permanent data like the BIOS.,"RAM is volatile memory that temporarily stores data for quick CPU access and loses contents when powered off. ROM is non-volatile memory that permanently stores firmware and boot instructions, retaining data without power. RAM is read-write while ROM is primarily read-only.",Computer memory hierarchy includes registers, cache, RAM, and secondary storage. RAM typically operates at nanosecond access speeds.
q006,Explain the concept of supply and demand,Supply and demand is an economic model that determines prices. When demand exceeds supply prices rise. When supply exceeds demand prices fall. The equilibrium price is where supply equals demand.,"Supply and demand is a fundamental economic model explaining how prices are determined in a market. Demand represents consumers' willingness to buy at various prices, while supply represents producers' willingness to sell. The intersection of supply and demand curves determines the market equilibrium price and quantity.",Economic theory suggests that markets tend toward equilibrium where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.
q007,What is machine learning?,Machine learning is a subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on training data.,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through exposure to more data.",Machine learning approaches include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Common algorithms include neural networks, decision trees, and SVMs.
q008,How do vaccines work?,Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens. They contain weakened or inactive parts of a virus or bacteria that trigger an immune response without causing disease.,"Vaccines stimulate the immune system by introducing antigens (weakened, killed, or partial pathogens) that trigger the production of antibodies and memory cells. This prepares the immune system to quickly recognize and neutralize the actual pathogen if encountered in the future.",The immune system consists of innate and adaptive immunity. Vaccines primarily work by activating the adaptive immune response and creating immunological memory.
q009,What is the greenhouse effect?,The greenhouse effect is when gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the Sun. These gases like CO2 and methane act like a blanket keeping the planet warm enough to support life.,"The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain atmospheric gases (CO2, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere. While essential for life, enhanced greenhouse effect from human emissions is causing global warming.",Greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation at specific wavelengths. CO2 concentrations have increased from 280 ppm pre-industrial to over 420 ppm today.
q010,Explain how DNS works,DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. When you type a website name your computer queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address to connect to.,"DNS is a hierarchical naming system that translates domain names to IP addresses. When you enter a URL, your device queries recursive resolvers, which check root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative nameservers to resolve the domain to its IP address, enabling network communication.",DNS uses a hierarchical structure with root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative nameservers. Common record types include A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, and TXT records.
